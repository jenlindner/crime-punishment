## About the Project
<hr>
All over Chicago, every day, people commit crimes. This project presents the data that documents these crimes and what, if any, response there is from the criminal justice system.

The documentation is immense. Some is published. Much of it is not. Our goal is to create a flat, simple guide to what is known and what is not.
